#HR2510-PB112
This is a high level library for both driving the HR2510 display as a SPI master and building an 
alternative display as a SPI slave.  The HR2510 PB112 board is commonly bad and uses a propritary display.

# Based on Code from KTMS1201
A high level Arduino library for the KTM-S1201 LCD module. Based on the [Tronixstuff's work](http://tronixstuff.com/2013/03/11/arduino-and-ktm-s1201-lcd-modules/) and the Arduino print class. This library makes it really easy to interface with the LCD, and add it to you existing project. Make sure to check out [the examples](https://github.com/MCUdude/KTMS1201/tree/master/examples) for getting the most out of this library!
